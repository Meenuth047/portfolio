## üõ†Ô∏è Featured Projects

### **[ros-wheel-rpm-visualization](https://github.com/smtbhd32/ros-wheel-rpm-visualization)**
A ROS project with C++ and Python scripts that subscribe to `cmd_vel` for robot linear and angular velocities. It calculates wheel RPMs and visualizes them in real-time using Matplotlib. Shared memory facilitates data exchange between scripts, while HTTP requests are used to send data to external services.

### **[pallet-detection-and-segmentation](https://github.com/smtbhd32/pallet-detection-and-segmentation)**
A ROS-based project focused on pallet detection and segmentation using fine-tuned YOLOv11 and YOLOv11-seg models. The object detection node processes images from the camera topic, while an image publisher node simulates a camera by publishing images from a folder.

### **[slam_bot_with_fusion360](https://github.com/smtbhd32/slam_bot_with_fusion360)**
This project simulates a ROS-based SLAM robot using Fusion 360 for 3D modeling and URDF export, along with Gazebo for testing. The robot uses LIDAR and differential drive for localization and mapping, with manual control via the `teleop_twist_keyboard` package.

### **[Ender3V3SE](https://github.com/smtbhd32/Ender3V3SE)**
A comprehensive guide for the Ender 3 V3 SE 3D printer, covering setup, maintenance, and troubleshooting. It includes guidance on configuring Cura profiles and resolving common issues like bed leveling.

### **[sia10f_robot](https://github.com/smtbhd32/sia10f_robot)**
This repository contains simulation files for the Motoman SIA10F robot. It was created to help developers who struggled to find the `sia10f_description` package online. The simulation is based on resources from The Construct team, FH Aachen, and Alberto Ezquerro Baraibar. All credits go to the original authors.

### **[sia10f-urdf-moveit-motion-planning](https://github.com/smtbhd32/sia10f-urdf-moveit-motion-planning)**
A project focused on simulating the Motoman SIA10F robot arm using the MoveIt package in ROS1. This project aims to create a complete codebase for motion planning with ROS, as taught in The Construct‚Äôs tutorial on programming industrial robots.

### **[The-ESP32-ChatGPT-Powered-Voice-Speaker](https://github.com/smtbhd32/The-ESP32-ChatGPT-Powered-Voice-Speaker)**
This project integrates the ESP32 microcontroller with ChatGPT to create a voice-powered speaker system. Using text-to-speech (TTS) and speech recognition, users can interact with ChatGPT through voice commands, enabling conversational AI features.

### **[Seismic-data-monitoring](https://github.com/smtbhd32/Seismic-data-monitoring)**
An earthquake alert system built using the ESP32 microcontroller, MPU6052 accelerometer, and ThingSpeak cloud platform. The system provides real-time earthquake data, with optional SMS notifications via Twilio.

### **[Robotic-Arm](https://github.com/smtbhd32/Robotic-Arm)**
A 6-DOF robotic arm controlled wirelessly via a custom mobile application. This project is designed for hobbyists and educators interested in robotics and embedded systems, providing real-time control over the robotic arm using a smartphone or tablet.

### **[e-ChallanX](https://github.com/smtbhd32/e-ChallanX)**
A digital solution for traffic violation challan management. The platform allows users to view outstanding challans, pay fines online, and challenge unjust challans. It uses AI cameras and traffic police to issue challans, all of which are recorded on a centralized server.

### **[eyrc22_SD_3331](https://github.com/smtbhd32/eyrc22_SD_3331)**
Part of the E-Yantra 2022 competition, this project involves an autonomous drone that surveys a city, detecting and locating yellow objects. The drone transmits the geolocation of detected objects via a ROS topic, which is then displayed on a city map in real-time using QGIS.

### **[Access-Control-System](https://github.com/smtbhd32/Access-Control-System)**
A web app that enables admins to manage access control for apps and services on a user's side, streamlining security and permissions.

### **[Smart-Traffic-Light-System](https://github.com/smtbhd32/Smart-Traffic-Light-System)**
A smart traffic light system that adapts to real-time traffic conditions. It uses a sensing network to dynamically adjust traffic signals based on current traffic density.

### **[vision](https://github.com/smtbhd32/vision)**
A dynamic to-do list web app that uses local storage to save data, providing an easy-to-use interface for task management.

### **[rai-ymca21.github.io](https://github.com/smtbhd32/rai-ymca21.github.io)**
An open-source website designed to help college students access study materials, guidance on online courses, and other useful resources.
